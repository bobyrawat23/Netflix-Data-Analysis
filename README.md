# About Dataset

Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be found here. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021.The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and visualization skills. The cleaned data can be found below and the Tableau dashboard can be found here .

# Data Cleaning

We are going to:
1. Treat the Nulls
2. Treat the duplicates
3. Populate missing rows
4. Drop unneeded columns
5. Split columns

# Project Summary:

- I began by cleaning the dataset, removing duplicates, and handling missing values where appropriate.
- I created a quick KPI snapshot to highlight total titles, Movies vs TV Shows, top countries, and most frequent genres.
- I explored the distribution of content types, genre popularity, ratings, country-level contributions, and release timelines.
- I added interactive visualizations and calculated average movie durations by genre to highlight viewer engagement patterns.

# Conclusion:

- Netflix’s catalog is heavily skewed toward Movies, with Drama, Documentaries, and Comedy as leading genres.
- The most frequent maturity rating is TV-MA, indicating a strategic focus on mature audiences.
- The majority of movie durations fall between 80 and 100 minutes — ideal for holding viewer attention.
- Content additions peaked between 2018 and 2020, reflecting Netflix’s expansion phase.

These insights directly support content acquisition planning, viewer targeting, and strategic regional growth.

# Future Enhancement

Based on my analysis, I’ve identified several business-focused enhancements that can help Netflix make smarter, data-driven decisions moving forward:

1. 📊 Build an Interactive Executive Dashboard  
Develop a dashboard where leadership can filter content by genre, country, release year, and rating. This enables real-time, visual decision support for planning and investments.

2. 🎯 Integrate Content ROI and Engagement Metrics  
Link this dataset with internal viewership and retention metrics to prioritize content that drives the most engagement and long-term value.

3. 🌍 Identify Market Gaps for Strategic Expansion  
Analyze country-level data to detect underserved regions. These insights can guide regional content investments or local production deals.

4. 🔮 Forecast Genre Trends Using Machine Learning  
Use past content trends to build models that predict emerging genres or formats. This can help Netflix stay ahead of changing viewer behavior.

5. 💼 Align Content with Subscriber Tiers  
Combine content insights with subscription data (e.g., Basic, Premium) to understand which content drives upgrades or loyalty — enabling better bundling and personalization.

📌 Together, these enhancements turn this project into a strategic asset that can guide Netflix’s global growth, improve ROI on content, and deliver a more personalized viewer experience.
